Here is the original code we see there are many divs and unnecessary classes. Such as div class="header" and div class="footer" while working it can be an eye sore keeping up with all the div classes. With doing so had to change the styles in the css to no longer be classified as a class so in their case header and footer.
Following unnecessary divs under h1 in header we replace tbat for nav and follow up in css removing divs in any header styles
Removing classes on the img while okay it's an unnecessary class when we could do so in the img css and replaced those with alt descriptives.
Search-engine-optimaization wasn't id so replacing the div class to be section id while keeping the class content keeps the page and articles within ordered and linked accordingly
